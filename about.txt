a little about ppp (precise point positioning) :    

      PPP uses accurate orbital data AND accurate satellite clock data as provided
e.g. by the IGS, and DUAL-frequency pseudo-range AND carrier phase observations collected
by the user, and uses the ionosphere-free function of the observables

2--------------

PPP implies single
receiver positioning (as far as the user is concerned). The second receiver, needed in the
double difference approach, is essentially replaced by the collection of continuously operating
receivers around the world.

3------------
The theoretical foundation of PPP is documented in Zumberge et al. (1997a). They set
out to develop an efficient approach to make the "accuracy achieved at IGS for global
solutions" available to users. They recognized that various networks of stations have been
established around the world to satisfy the need for high accuracy positioning. An example is
the CORS network consisting of some 80 plus stations operated by the NGS (National
Geodetic Survey). These networks typically serve on the premise of relative positioning, i.e.
the user will position himself relative to the nearest CORS station. Sophisticated users might
